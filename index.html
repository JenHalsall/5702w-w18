<p>The sources for the history of our times are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/gothamist-dnainfo-shut-down-as-billionaire-ricketts-cites-costs">fragile</a>. Joe Ricketts, the billionaire owner of DNAInfo and Gothamist, shut the local news publications down rather than tolerate a unionized workforce. For 11 minutes, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/11/03/twitter-briefly-and-immeasurab.html">Trump was kicked off Twitter</a>. Ian Bogost sees in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/sorry-that-page-doesnt-exist/544934/">both episodes a symptom of a deeper problem</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>both are pulling on the same brittle levers that have made the contemporary social, economic, and political environment so lawless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As public historians, what are we to do about this? There are a lot of issues highlighted here, but let&rsquo;s start at the most basic. <em>It takes nothing to delete the record</em>. The fragility of materials online is both a danger, and an opportunity, for us. Some scholars have <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/rogue-scientists-race-save-climate-data-trump/">&ldquo;gone rogue&rdquo;</a> in trying to deal with this problem. That is to say, they neither sought nor obtained permission. They just scoped out a process, and <em>did</em> it.</p>

<p>I initially called this class &lsquo;guerrilla public digital history&rsquo; partly tongue in cheek. I imagined us doing some augmented reality type projects in public spaces. Reprogramming those public spaces. Using digital techs to surface hidden histories, and insert them into spaces where they didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;belong&rsquo;. Counterprogramming. That was the &lsquo;guerilla&rsquo; bit.</p>

<p>I still want to do all that. But I think we&rsquo;re going to have to do a bit more. Digital Public Historians have a role to play I suspect in countering the information power asymmetry. These ways are impromptu, without authorization. Rogue. Improvised.</p>

<p>What is a &lsquo;guerilla digital public history&rsquo;?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. But we&rsquo;re going to find out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;a guerrilla narrative is the] interrupting [of] mainstream organized narratives through counter hegemonic storytelling, and the sabotage of toxic narratives &hellip;  particularly those which reproduce or silence injustice&hellip; Methodologically, adopting a guerrilla narrative approach implies a commitment towards the co-design and co-production of knowledge and the recognition of storytelling as a fundamental tool in this process.  - Iengo, Ilenia and Armiero, M. The politicization of ill bodies in Campania, Italy. Journal of Political Ecology 24 (2017) <a href="http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf">http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf</a></p>

<p>Guerrilla narrative can also be considered an expansion of the oral history methodology to include word-based memoirs, images, videos, audio recordings, and different forms of art among the different storytelling tools. Moreover, the expression guerrilla narrative implies the exercise of storytelling as a deliberate counter-hegemonic strategy, with an explicit political aim. - Ilenia Iengo and Marco Armiero &ldquo;Toxic Bios: A guerrilla narrative project mapping contamination, illness and resistance&rdquo; 3 Nov 2017 <a href="https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/">https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/</a></p>

<p>What are the stories in Ottawa that require a guerilla digital public history?</p>

<p>What do you need to know in order to tell such a story?</p>

<p>In this course, we will develop a guerilla digital public history cookbook and perhaps even put some of it into practice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Associate Professor of Digital Humanities in the Department of History at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.</p>

<p>No one is more surprised by this than me.</p>

<h4 id="interests">Interests</h4>

<ul>
<li>Computational Creativity for History &amp; Archaeology</li>
<li>Open Access Everything</li>

<p><img src="https://shawngraham.github.io/img/portrait.jpg" alt="This is me" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on things like machine learning, and the dodgy trade in human remains, and a textbook on digital archaeology with its own integrated computational environment. Recently I designed, built, and launched a journal for creativity in history and archaeology called <a href="http://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca">Epoiesen</a>. The journal went live in October 2017.</p>
