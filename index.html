<p>A sprawling crescent of fields and forests, the Greenbelt is composed of approximately 200 square kilometers of federally-owned land in the city of Ottawa, Ontario. Created in 1958 as a result of Jacques Greber's <em>Plan for Canada's Capital</em>, it was intended to limit urban sprawl, allocate a supply of land for future institutional use, and preserve a selection of greenspace within easy reach of the downtown core.</p>

<p>The lands now comprising the majority of the Greenbelt originally belonged to the townships of Nepean and Gloucester, which have since been amalgamated into Ottawa. In Gloucester, the affected area was overwhelmingly rural, occupied by family farms and small businesses. Landowners were given a choice: sell willingly to the National Capital Commission, the agency responsible for implementing Greber's vision in the National Capital Region; or face expropriation. As land was relinquished, the Commission proposed a new arrangement for affected landowners whose properties were not slated to be immediately re-purposed. Former owners were offered short-term leases and the opportunity to become tenants on their own land.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>â€œWhat is important is that, outside the limits so defined, there be maintained a rural belt, subjected to control to the end that the periphery of the urban area be protected against all undesirable or linear subdivisions or developments."</p>
<em>Plan for Canada's Capital, 191.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Although early plans for the Greenbelt proposed a largely agricultural focus, a practice of reforestation and naturalization soon developed. Large tracts of agricultural land were re-classified as conservation areas. While intensive ecologically-focused activities did occur at several sites, many fields were simply left to gradually grow over. Homes, businesses, and outbuildings were also removed from the landscape.</p>

<p> Today's Greenbelt appears radically changed when compared to its likeness 50 years ago. A wealth of public conservation and recreation areas are maintained, while agriculture and habitation have become secondary distinctions. The Commission now maintains approximately 85 farmsteads for lease, and an estimated 1,000 individuals live within the bounds of this green expanse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;a guerrilla narrative is the] interrupting [of] mainstream organized narratives through counter hegemonic storytelling, and the sabotage of toxic narratives &hellip;  particularly those which reproduce or silence injustice&hellip; Methodologically, adopting a guerrilla narrative approach implies a commitment towards the co-design and co-production of knowledge and the recognition of storytelling as a fundamental tool in this process.  - Iengo, Ilenia and Armiero, M. The politicization of ill bodies in Campania, Italy. Journal of Political Ecology 24 (2017) <a href="http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf">http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf</a></p>

<p>Guerrilla narrative can also be considered an expansion of the oral history methodology to include word-based memoirs, images, videos, audio recordings, and different forms of art among the different storytelling tools. Moreover, the expression guerrilla narrative implies the exercise of storytelling as a deliberate counter-hegemonic strategy, with an explicit political aim. - Ilenia Iengo and Marco Armiero &ldquo;Toxic Bios: A guerrilla narrative project mapping contamination, illness and resistance&rdquo; 3 Nov 2017 <a href="https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/">https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/</a></p>

<p>What are the stories in Ottawa that require a guerilla digital public history?</p>

<p>What do you need to know in order to tell such a story?</p>

<p>In this course, we will develop a guerilla digital public history cookbook and perhaps even put some of it into practice.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE!!!!!!!!!</b></p>

<p>This is a studio course. We will spend very little time <em>in class</em> on readings, as such; when we do discuss such things, it will be to provide context for what we are <em>doing</em>. I&rsquo;m inspired very much by the work of historian Bill Turkle, who says to his own students in a similar kind of studio-led course,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of your in-class time will be devoted to experimenting with various kinds of technologies and learning how to apply them.  It is playful and open-ended, and most of the drive has to come from you.  I provide tools and equipment, I can show you how it works and suggest ways you might use it, and if you get stuck I can help you figure out a way forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That goes for us too.</p>

<p>This can be disappointing if you are expecting a more traditional arrangement. If you want to learn how to do computational analysis of historical texts, I&rsquo;d suggest the self-directed version of <a href="http://craftingdigitalhistory.ca">Crafting Digital History</a> would be more appropriate for you. But in <em>this</em> class, we&rsquo;re doing something very different.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns, get in touch right away.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong> As the schedule, supporting readings, and work we do can change rapidly, I&rsquo;m electing to use the Wiki attached to this course repository for handling any updates. <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/5702w-w18/wiki">Please check the course wiki for the latest course information &amp; syllabus.</a></p>

<p>At a minimum, you&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>an account with Github <em>or</em> a domain of your own</li>
<li>an account with Hypothesis</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not you use your own name in any part of your username is up to you - you can be pseudonymous.</p>

<p>Join our 5702w collaborative web annotation group <a href="https://hypothes.is/groups/mjpB4yX9/hist5702w">here</a>. If you&rsquo;ve not used Hypothesis before, <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/">here is some help</a>.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-techy">Do I need to be &lsquo;techy&rsquo;?</h2>

<p>What does that mean, &lsquo;techy&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s worth pondering. Short answer: no. If you can write an email, there&rsquo;s nothing we&rsquo;ll do in this course that is beyond you.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-happens-if-something-doesn-t-work">But what happens if something doesn&rsquo;t work?</h2>

<p>That is, in many ways, part of the point. Things will break. It&rsquo;s when things break that we discover how best they can serve the broader goal. You will keep track of what you do, what you&rsquo;re thinking, as you experiment and push yourself.</p>

<h2 id="glorious-failure-is-as-valuable-as-glorious-success">Glorious Failure is as valuable as Glorious Success</h2>

<p>An ambitious project that succeeds is <em>just as</em> important to me as an ambitious project that fails spectacularly: both earn high grades! Document everything, and swing for the bleachers. <em>That</em> is the recipe for success. You&rsquo;re welcome to play it safe, but know that playing it safe leads to lower grades.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on things like machine learning, and the dodgy trade in human remains, and a textbook on digital archaeology with its own integrated computational environment. Recently I designed, built, and launched a journal for creativity in history and archaeology called <a href="http://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca">Epoiesen</a>. The journal went live in October 2017.</p>
