<p>A sprawling crescent of fields and forests, the Greenbelt is composed of approximately 200 square kilometers of federally-owned land in the city of Ottawa, Ontario. Created in 1958 as a result of Jacques Greber's <em>Plan for Canada's Capital</em>, it was intended to limit urban sprawl, allocate a supply of land for future institutional use, and preserve a selection of greenspace within easy reach of the downtown core.</p>

<p>The lands now comprising the majority of the Greenbelt originally belonged to the townships of Nepean and Gloucester, which have since been amalgamated into Ottawa. In Gloucester, the affected area was overwhelmingly rural, occupied by family farms and small businesses. Landowners were given a choice: sell willingly to the National Capital Commission, the agency responsible for implementing Greber's vision in the National Capital Region; or face expropriation. All told, over 1,000 land parcels were purchased by the federal government for the Greenbelt. As land was relinquished, the Commission proposed a new arrangement for affected landowners whose properties were not slated to be immediately re-purposed. Former owners were offered short-term leases and the opportunity to become tenants on their own land.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What is important is that, outside the limits so defined, there be maintained a rural belt, subjected to control to the end that the periphery of the urban area be protected against all undesirable or linear subdivisions or developments."</p>
<em>Plan for Canada's Capital, 191.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Although early plans for the Greenbelt proposed a largely agricultural focus, a practice of reforestation and naturalization soon developed. Large tracts of agricultural land were re-classified as conservation areas, and the population living inside the Greenbelt plummetted. While intensive ecologically-focused activities did occur at several sites, many fields were simply left to gradually grow over. Homes, businesses, and outbuildings were also removed from the landscape.</p>

<p> Today's Greenbelt appears radically changed when compared to its likeness 50 years ago. A wealth of public conservation and recreation areas are maintained, while agriculture and habitation have become secondary distinctions. The Commission now maintains approximately 85 farmsteads for lease, and an estimated 1,000 individuals live within the bounds of this green expanse.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE!!!!!!!!!</b></p>

<p>This is a studio course. We will spend very little time <em>in class</em> on readings, as such; when we do discuss such things, it will be to provide context for what we are <em>doing</em>. I&rsquo;m inspired very much by the work of historian Bill Turkle, who says to his own students in a similar kind of studio-led course,</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1Dy-SzU1WqZvVcNr-5UNIdTvV82g" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

<p>That goes for us too.</p>

<p>This can be disappointing if you are expecting a more traditional arrangement. If you want to learn how to do computational analysis of historical texts, I&rsquo;d suggest the self-directed version of <a href="http://craftingdigitalhistory.ca">Crafting Digital History</a> would be more appropriate for you. But in <em>this</em> class, we&rsquo;re doing something very different.</p>

<p>So how then, can these complex and interwoven memories be translated into the digital realm? How can the nuances of place, space, and identity coexist when they are removed from their original contexts? Digital history exists in a fundamentally different space than traditional print media, and is prone to more sudden shifts in form, process and function. In recent years, it has become a popular tool for the democratization of knowledge, particularly that found in oral histories like those in the Greenbelt project. New tools, such as Steven High’s “Stories Matter” platform, evidence the increasing attention paid to digital archiving and the importance of local storytelling.  Similarly, virtual displays like  Kathryn Boschmann’s “Being Irish on the Prairies” and Shawn Graham’s “Pembrooke Soundscapes” are now able to incorporate multifaceted narratives into public outreach projects, stitching together audio, video, textual, cartographic and photographic components to display compelling narratives.  The advent of new digital technologies then represents a fundamental shift for oral history as it concerns a broader public audience. This is particularly true for local history projects, which have the benefit of an engaged and easily defined audience. As Susana Smith Bautista has asserted, “technology can best serve a museum’s community when that community –or subcommunity—is well-defined, even narrowly defined to the point of becoming dangerously stagnant.”</p>

<p>The Greenbelt project capitalizes on these advantages, making use of multimedia storytelling to make local knowledge more accessible to those who choose to identify with the area. The basis for the platform stems from Livio Sansone’s writings on digital exhibition and archiving. Much like Sansone’s Digital Museum of African and Afro-Brazilian Memory, the Greenbelt exhibition “through it all, is as much a public service as it is a tool for research.”  It exists as a tangible product for the people who dedicated their time and their personal knowledge, and serves as a new oral history resource for those seeking to learn about their perceive community or place. Following Henning’s assertion that “new media is most interesting for its subversion and alteration of hierarchies of knowledge,” the digital component may also be viewed as a reassertion of local knowledge over that produced by institutional actors.  It provides an important counternarrative to the public perception of the Greenbelt as ahistorical and empty, and reasserts the existence of a long agricultural tradition found just outside of Ottawa downtown core.</p>

<p>The Gloucester Greenbelt is not the first high modernist megaproject to become the focus of digital history projects. Indeed, multimedia elements like Joy Parr’s “Megaprojects New Media” have proven incredibly valuable in contextualizing the personal stories of affected persons and teasing out more robust narratives of change, community, and identity.  In showcasing the collected recollections of Gloucester residents digitally, the project allows for greater distribution of local knowledge beyond the physical boundaries of the Greenbelt. However, as Shawn Graham notes, “to digitize is not to democratize,” and issues with institutional and curatorial authority, accessibility, and contextualization remain a concern for digital products.  In the case of the Greenbelt, narratives, photos, documents, cognitive maps and other digitized “artefacts” are removed from their original contexts, weakening the connection between display, identity, and place. This is further problematized by the web-based platform’s untethered existence –unlike the individuals who have shared their recollections, visitors to the site need not reside in the Ottawa area. These histories can be accessible from thousands of kilometers away, inviting strangers and former residents alike to peruse the content without ever forming a connection to the landscape itself. The content is, to an extent, “de-placed.”</p>

<p>This is the challenge that faced Peter Dawson and Richard Levy, two historians who sought to create a virtual exhibition of Fort Conger. Owned by Parks Canada, the early scientific research post is located on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut and is among the most remote of Canada’s national parks. For Dawson and Levy, the creation of a virtual exhibition would circumvent geographical remoteness and allow Canadians across the country to explore the site and discover its unique historical importance. However, this remoteness is one of the many place-based attributes that make Fort Conger so distinctive. Dawson and Levy summarized the problems inherent to the exhibition’s creation with two queries: “To what degree are the meanings and values associated with the real Fort Conger transferred to its digital replica?” And, who defines these meanings?”  The Greenbelt storytelling platform grapples with a similar tension, focusing on place and community while simultaneously uprooting the attached narratives.</p>

<p>As Dawson and Levy suggest, the transfer of values and beliefs expressed through oral testimony is among the most pressing issues stemming from the creation of a digital storytelling component. Digital media have been recognized for their “sizeable and ever-increasing effect on the ways in which memory can be, an is being, represented and reconfigured in the early years of the 21st century.”  New communication technologies “have a profound impact on the construction of collective memory and its relationship with the process of identity,” and the act of assuming an identity in the digital space is a unique process. It is fundamentally different from the creation of an “analog” experience. A digital exhibition must invoke new strategies to preserve and authentically share narrative and memory as best it can while renegotiating anchors like place, time, and community integration.  Henning has argued that communications media may be divided into two groups: those which convey a message through time, and those which move it through space.   Never have these groups met more fully than in the digital, where memory-based installments erode space-time differences, greatly impacting an exhibition’s authenticity.</p> 

<p>One popular means of retaining connections to place and community in digital exhibitions is the creation of interactive maps and the arrangement of content in a geographically-linked structure. By anchoring content to a perceived location, scholars and interpreters seek to re-establish a connection to place. The Greenbelt exhibition embraces this popular methodology by locating individual oral testimony on an interactive map of Gloucester. Stories are mapped by farmstead facilitate navigability, but also to provide a physical juxtaposition of the Gloucester Greenbelt’s past and current meanings. However, this attempt at place establishment is not without its flaws. Much as virtual galleries and museums use descriptors like “halls, exhibitions and collections” as metaphors for physical space, so too does the Greenbelt project’s reliance on cartography act as a flimsy stand-in for the sense of place expressed through oral testimony.  Indeed, the map exposes one of the most crucial limitations of web-based digital storytelling: as of yet, it is not sensory. Where geographic place exists, landscape is absent. The whistle of wind through green hay and the humid odour of manure cannot be translated, nor can the vast emptiness of a disused field.  Instead, the embedded map relies on familiar institutional markers to establish place –a reliance that can erode the voice of counternarratives expressed through testimony.</p>

<p>Concerns over audience also have their place in the digital realm, where too often “more than an antidote, the internet reflects inequalities –and makes them clear for others to see and interpret.”  Many of the persons interviewed for the Greenbelt project chose not to maintain a digital presence, and while pleased with the creation of a digital exhibition, seemed largely uninterested in experiencing any web-based product firsthand. For some, the preferred method for review was to have mock-ups printed on large sheets of paper and delivered to their homes, where they could mark changes in pen and pencil. There also exist many challenges limiting users’ ability to access the knowledge, quite independent from personal preference. Technical literacy, closed algorithms for search engines, and unequal access to quality hardware further erode the digital platform’s claims to democracy.  The challenge then became creating an exhibition capable of accurately reflecting respondents’ insights, memories, and connections to landscapes and communities in a fundamentally “placeless” realm they may never visit. Careful revision has mitigated some of this issue, giving participants an opportunity to comment upon the framing of their stories well in advance of the publication date. However, the production of a traditional document summarizing the results of the research is also in progress, providing respondents with an alternative –if more private—means of reflecting on the project.</p>

<p>However, the digital component is by no means superfluous. There exists a vibrant local interest in Gloucester’s past, and the historical society alone has over 100 active members. The digital component is a public and accessible opportunity to add to Gloucester’s historical narrative, and encourages residents to submit their own stories. As a “living resource” stemming from community involvement, it follows such projects as “The Quilt Index,” an online resource which preserved more than 50,000 images of quilts. Observing the project’s Facebook page, Amanda Sikarskie noticed “on several occasions, fans have demonstrated a strong knowledge of a particular historical period or type of quilt, or have even suggested ways in which a quilt’s metadata record might be more complete.” She likens this co-creation as a form of teacher-student communication, in that dialogue occurs but control ultimately rests with whomever manages the web resource.  A similar focus on community engagement and co-creation is reflected in the Gloucester Greenbelt web resource, which invokes co-curation not only in editing and refinement, but also in the collection and presentation of material.</p>

<p>However, instead of an archive-focused retention of control, the digital storytelling platform borrows from Ramesh Srinivasan, Katherine Becvar, Robin Boast, and Jim Enote, who call to “return expertise to the museum, but expertise with a small ‘e.’” Curatorial authority is to be shared, and exhibits opened to “multiple knowledgeable uses, for multiple communities, and the equitable expression of those performances.”  Rather than imposing a singular narrative, this “collected” showcase of oral storytelling maintains individual narratives as distinct entities and allows for more accurate replication of place-based and community ties. This methodology reflects that of Brooke Hessler, who notes “we are never occupying only one role or conveying only one narrative. There is always more to the story.”  To further facilitate transparency and narrative diversity, a summary page explaining the collection and curatorial processes will summarize the aforementioned methodological choices.</p> 

<p>Finally, it is important to reflect on the nature of archiving as it relates to this project. Henning has remarked that “storage mania” marked the early years of new media, as anything that could be collected was digitized and archived.  While the digital resource is intended to showcase these local accounts, it is not intended to function as a digital repository for materials, as the Quilt Index does. The reasons for this decision are two-fold. Firstly, the scope of documentation required for proper online archiving through this platform would significantly erode usability for casual, local browsers. As Joy Parr has asked, “if we are privy only to the digitized transcripts produced from interviews, not the processes and context that informed their making, how will we make good use of the information accumulating in digital archives?”   Interviews thus require careful contextualization entailing the conditions under which they were conducted, as well as proper metadata tagging and the creation of an arrangement structure that is both functional and reflective of participants’ values. Taken together, this wealth of information runs the rick of overshadowing personal narratives, and yet a proper archive cannot function without it. The second justification for removing archival function is more simple: while this digital platform is intended as a community resource, its long-term viability is not as of yet guaranteed. Until a suitable long-term plan may be formulated outlining cost-sharing for web hosting, maintenance duties, and ownership, integrating archiving functionality –which is in itself long-term—remains be irresponsible.</p>
